# Caesar-Cipher-with-the-C-programming-language

This program is a C program that utilizes the Caesar encryption method to encrypt and decrypt a text.

## How It Works

The program takes input from the user for a student's name, surname, and a key value. It encrypts the concatenated student name and surname and prints the encrypted text. It also saves the encrypted text to a file. It then reads the saved file, decrypts the text, and displays the original message.

## Usage

To run the program, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have a C compiler installed.
2. Compile and run the `caesar_encryption.c` file.
3. The program will prompt you to enter a student's name, surname, and a key value.
4. After entering the student name and surname, you will see the encrypted text on the screen. It will also be saved to a file named `encryptedText.txt`.
5. The program will read the saved file, display the encrypted text, and decrypt it to obtain the original message.
